        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We implemented a cloth simulator using the mass-spring method of representing a cloth. Additionally,
            we implemented common GLSL shaders to render the cloth in the viewport. This project supports
            the following features:
       
            <li>
                <a href="#part1">Part 1: Masses and Springs</a>
                <p>
                    In this section, we created a grid of point masses that will represent our cloth. 
                    To connect the point masses together, we implemented springs between the point masses
                    that will then be used to simulate internal forces within the cloth.  
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Simulation via Numerical Integration</a>
                <p>
                    We applied external and internal forces in order to physically simulate our cloth. To do this, we calculated
                    the total force on each point mass and then updated its position. Also, to ensure the cloth 
                    stays intact, we took inspiration off of a paper and implemented constraints ensuring that the distance between
                    two point masses did not exceed 110% of the rest length at any given time. 

                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Handling Collisions with Other Objects</a>
                <p>
                    We handled collisions between the cloth and other primitives. Here, we determined 
                    whether the cloth fell inside an object and revised each point mass's new position to be outside of the object. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Handling Self-Collisions</a>
                <p>
                    While the cloth can interact with other objects, it also needs to be able to recognize itself as a collider
                    to prevent clipping. In order to handle self-collision, we built a hash-map that maps each point mass's position
                    to a unique box in 3D space, and correct a particular point mass's position based upon the positions
                    of other point masses within the same box.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Shading</a>
                <p>
                    We implemented various GLSL shader programs for diffuse and blinn-phong materials. We also 
                    supported shaders for texture mapping, bump and displacement mapping, a reflective
                    mirror-like material, and a toon shader.
                </p>
             </li>
             <li><a href="#part6">Part 6: Wind Solver</a>
                <p>
                    We added wind to the cloth simulation by creating a sinusoidal wind field
                    and applying the force due to the field to the cloth.
                </p>
             </li>

        <p>
            We initialized a grid of point masses and filled in each point mass's attribute. For example,
            we needed to determine whether or not a point mass was pinned (so that part of the cloth wouldn't
            fall during simulation), and what the point mass's position is. Additionally, we needed to initialize
            spring forces between each point mass. There are three springs that we implemented to simulate the cloth:
            <ol>
                <li>Structural constraints, which exist between point masses directly above, below, left, or right of
                    a given point mass
                </li>
                <li>Shearing constraints, which exist between point masses diagonal to each other</li>
                <li>Bending constraints, which exist between a point mass and another point mass, two away from each other,
                    either above, below, left, or right
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of the debugging included making sure that the spring constraints were implemented
            correctly, as there are lots of edge cases to take into account (for example, we will not
            initialize any springs for a point mass on the upper-left most corner, and a point mass on the
            rightmost side won't have one of the shearing constraints, and sometimes structural or bending constraints
            for the upper one or two point masses). 
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2 align="middle" id="part2">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <p>
            We implemented basic cloth simulation due to internal and external forces on the cloth.
            First, we calculated the contribution of the force on a particular point mass due to external forces
            (such as gravity) using Newton's 2nd law, which states that:
        </p>
            <div class="mathjax">
                \(F = ma\)
             </div>
         <p>
            where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration (for this project, a is just the force due to 
             gravity).
        </p>
        <p>
             Next, we calculated the contribution due to intrinsic forces in the cloth, namely, those due to the spring
              constraints. The force applied due to a spring is given by Hooke's law, which states that:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
            \(F_s = k_s * (||p_a - p_b|| - l)\)
        </div>
        <p>
            where F_s is the force due to a spring, k_s is the spring constant, p_a and p_b refer to positions
            of point masses a and b respectively, and l is the spring mass's rest length.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we want our bending constraints to be weaker, we scaled the force down due to bending
            constraints by a factor of 0.2.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we used Verlet integration to compute the new positions of each point mass due to
            the net force caluclated, as explained above. At the next time interval, the updated position
            is expressed as
        </p>
            <div class="mathjax">
                \(
                    x_{t+dt} = x_t + v_t*dt+a_t*dt^2
                    \)
         </div>
            <p>
             Adding some damping in our simulation and because we have access to the position at time t-dt, we can then rewrite the above equation as:
        </p>
        <div class="mathjax">
            \(
                x_{t+dt} = x_t + (1-d)*(x_t -  x_{t+-dt} )+a_t*dt^2
                \)
        </div>
        <p>
            Lastly, to ensure that the distance due to each point mass doesn't get unreasonably large,
            we take inspiration from the<a href="https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~cutler/classes/advancedgraphics/S14/papers/provot_cloth_simulation_96.pdf">
                 SIGGRAPH 1995 Provot paper
            </a> and only allow the distance between each point mass to be at most 10% greater than its rest length.
        </p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                From observation of the images above, as the spring constant value increases, the cloth becomes more stiff and less droopy.
                This physical effect is explained by the fact that increasing the constant creates a sturdier spring which leads to the effect
                of not appearing as elastic for higher values of k. As we run the cloth sim, we notice for smaller 
                values of k that the cloth behaves more like a thin sheet, kind of like silk. For larger values of k, the cloth 
                behaves more like a sheet of stiff paper - less flowy movement per point mass as the cloth drops.

        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                As the density of the point masses increase, the cloth becomes similar to that of a 
                lower spring constant.
                The reason why changing the density value has the opposite effect of changing
                the spring constant is due to the fact that an increase in density corresponds to
                an increase in the point mass's mass, and thus, the point mass's mass would be affected
                by external forces such as the force due to gravity more than the force due to the surrounding springs.

            <figcaption>density = 1.0%</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            As the damping value increases, the cloth appears less wrinkly. Another way to describe the difference
            is the fact that the cloth comes to rest a lot faster that lower damping percentages and this is more apparent
            in the animation of cloth falling. Still, there are renmants that display the small pertubations. For example,
            in the image that displays damping at 0%, the ends of the fabric is still moving even after a long duration of letting
            the animation run. The image that shows damping at 1%, however, came to rest immediatly with totally straightened-out
            cloth at its ends.

    <h2 align="middle" id="part3">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
   <p>
        We handled collisions with spheres and planes. In the case of the sphere, we checked to 
        see if a given point mass's position was within the sphere (if the distance from the center
        of the sphere to the point mass is less than or equal to the radius of the sphere). If so,
        we updated the position so that it is just above the sphere's surface throught the use of a 
        correction vector.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the case of a plane, we checked for collision by determining if a given point mass
        had fallen from one side of the plane to the other. If so, we updated the position to 
        be on the former side of the plane. In order to implement this, we checked the sign
        of the dot product due to the surface normal of the plane and the vector from a given 
        point on the plane to the position of the point mass. If the sign of the dot product
        changed in a single time step, we know that the point mass had fallen from one side to
        the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, we applied a frictional force to the cloth and the sphere, so that the 
        cloth would not slide off the sphere and the plane.

            As the spring constant increases, the way the fabric sits on the sphere becomes more stiff. As mentioned before,
            this is due to the fact that the forces of the spring become stronger making the cloth less elastic.

    <h2 align="middle" id="part4">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
   <p>
    One issue in our current implementation was that the cloth was clipping in itself. Thus, we
    handled self-collisions via a hash table, where we store point masses in a particular hash if 
    they are neighboring each other. If we were to take each point mass and add up the force
    due to collision from all the point masses in the cloth, this would take n^2 time per time step.
    Thus, spatial hashing provides a faster, n-time algorithm for us to check collisions for each point mass.
   </p>
   <p>
    In order to create our hash function, we virtually partitioned 3D space into 3D boxes with size
   </p>
   <div class="mathjax">
    \(
        w*h*max(w,h)
        \)
    </div>
<p>
    where <code>w=3*width_of_the_cloth/num_width_points</code>, <code>h=3 * height_of_the_cloth / num_height_points</code>.
    We let the origin of the 3D space correspond to the corner for all 8 of these boxes. In other words,
    imagine that one wall of the box lay every <code>h</code> units in the z direction, w units in the x direction,
    and max(w,h) units in the y direction. If a particular point mass is within a certain box, we
    assign the point mass to that box in the hash table. Since hash values are represented as floats,
    we decided to floor divide each point mass's position by the dimensions of the box (which outputs the 
    vertex of the box closest to the origin; this is a <i>unique value</i> per box), and then took the 
    linear combination of the output:
</p>
<div class="mathjax">
    \(
        hashvalue = 101* box_x + 103 * box_y + 107 * box_z
        \)
</div>
    <p>
        The reason why we chose 101, 103, and 107 specifically is because they are large (enough) 
        prime numbers, so the chances of getting the same hash value for two different coordinates close to each
        other (enough to affect the efficiency of calculating self-collisions) would be low. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When we actually implement the self-collision, we need to make sure for a given point mass, that
        the other point masses belonging in the same hash value contribute to the correction vector of the 
        given point mass.
        We want to make sure this happens if the point mass is within 2*thickness apart from another 
        point mass.

    <h3>Varying Spring Constant Values</h3>
    <p>Throughout the entire simulation, we see that the cloth's mesh doesn't clip
        into itself. We implemented a data structure that allow us to test for collisions
        with point masses in surrounding boxes, and apply repulsive forces among them in 
        order to avoid clipping.

    <h2 align="middle" id="part5">Part 5: Shading</h2>
    <h3>
        What is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting
        and material effects?
    </h3>
    <p>
        A GLSL shader program offers a way to render simple materials in meshes in a fairly inexpensive way (as opposed to physically-based
        raytracing). Such a program consists of a vertex shader, and a fragment shader; A vertex shader applies transformations to vertices (such as scaling,
        rotation, and translation) and passes data to the fragment shader. The fragment shader processes fragments (pixels)
        generated by rasterizing primitives and generates a color for each pixel. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They work together by taking the output of the vertex shader and passing the data to fragment shader;
        this output consists of the final position of the vertex in screen space, vertex normals, vertex tangents, UV coordinates, etc.
        The fragment shader takes the vertex shader's outputs as its inputs and calculates the final color of each fragment by
        calculating the final color of a particular vertex, and interpolating it across the entire mesh due to the colors of other
        vertices.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Blinn-Phong combines ambient, diffuse, and specular components of lighting.
        Ambient lighting represents the overall light that illuminates all parts of the object uniformly.
        Diffuse lighting represents the light scattered equally in all directions off a matte surface.
        It's calculated using the Lambert cosine law, which involves the dot product between the surface normal and the
        direction of the light vector. In other words, the surface normals of an object will appear brighter if they 
        point towards the direction of the light source, and dimmer, if away. Specular lighting represents the highlights on glossy surfaces. It's calculated using
        the halfway vector between the direction of the light source and the direction of the viewer (eye). The intensity of
        specular reflection is determined by the dot product between the halfway vector and the surface normal raised to a
        power known as the shininess coefficient.

        We see that a higher number of samples corresponds to a better resolution in the bump and 
        displacement map's silhouette. The nxn samples correspond to the number of vertices 
        that show up in the geometry (note the low-poly silhouette of the 16x16 bump-mapping example
        compared to the 128x128, which has a smoother geometry). In the displacement mapping case, we
        note that the silhouette seems better defined with a higher number of samples, whereas the 16x16
        case results is a slightly jarring, lower-poly look. However, bump-mapping seems to perform better
        with a smaller amount of samples since the output with 16x16 samples and 128x128 samples look
        the same.

    <p>We created a custom GLSL fragment shader that changes colors depending on the position of the 
        camera to the origin, and gives it a toon-shading effect! We achieved this by calculating
        the diffuse of the object, and determining whether the amount of light emitted from the object
        is greater than or equal to 0.4. If so, we assign it a warm color. If not, we assign it a cool
        color, added on with some color changes due to the camera's position.

    <h2 align="middle" id="part6">Extra Credit</h2>
    <p>
        We implemented a simplified wind solver which takes in a point mass and a Vector3D wind direction as arguments. 
        The force contribution comes from multiplying the mass of the point mass with
        the acceleration due to a sinuosoidal wind field, calculated as follows given a particular x, y, and z basis:
    </p>
    <div class="mathjax">
        \(
            windfield.x =  winddirection.x * sin(2 \pi * (pointmassposition.x \mathbin{\%} freq) / freq))
            \)
    </div>
    <p>
        For our cases, we set the frequency to 1. We then   
        calculated a dot product between the vector form of the wind solver and 
        the normal vector of the point mass to determine how much of the wind will affect
        the cloth. Additionally, we added a small jitter vector (by generating a small random Vector3D
        contribution) to simulate randomness within the wind solver.
    </p>

        Here are some of the results from the wind solver:

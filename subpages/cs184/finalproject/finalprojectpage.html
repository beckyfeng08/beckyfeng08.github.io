<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    We developed an interactive mesh painting interface in JavaScript. Users can
     create texture maps by painting directly onto 3D meshes in a viewer, or by 
     painting on UV coordinates in a separate drawing application window. Additionally,
      users can import their own meshes and texture maps, save their newly created textures,
       and generate default meshes for painting.
</p>

<p>
    Our platform offers a fast and simple user interface for texturing meshes, catering to quick
    and casual needs, unlike more complex solutions such as 3D Substance Painter or Blender which are often
    used in a more professional context. We achieved this by leveraging front-end tools like 
    the Node.js environment, the Three.js API (which provides methods for creating a WebGL viewer,
     loading meshes, textures, raycasting, etc.), and the Canvas HTML element.
   
</p>
<h2> Technical Approach</h2>
<p>
    <b>We break our project down into several subparts:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Creating a WebGL 3D mesh renderer that can handle texture mapping
            <p>
                We followed the ThreeJS documentation to render on the 
                screen with a WebGL viewer, a camera, lights, materials, 
                a mesh object, interactivity with the viewer, and setting up a raycaster. 
                We also created a list of file paths that referred to a list of mesh 
                objects that we can load when the user presses “Generate Mesh.”

        </li>
        <li>
            Creating a working drawing app
            <p>
                We expanded upon the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y84tBZo8GFo">code 
                from CodingNepal </a>for our drawing app. 
                This implementation is based on the HTML canvas element. Modifications we made 
                (other than the CSS styling) include displaying brush/eraser size as a circle 
                around the moving cursor and supporting texture import and UV display features. 
                We also fixed some details about the original drawing application such as smoother
                 lines and correct alignment of the brush on resized windows.

            </p>

            <br>
            <figcaption> Our drawing app initially</figcaption>

            
        </li>
        <li>
            Combining the 3D renderer and drawing app for cross-functionality
            <p>
                ThreeJS supports the use of reading a texture file off of an HTML canvas element.
                 We utilized this to directly render a texture map onto our mesh from the drawing app. 
                 Because it would be costly to have to update the texture every frame, we chose to only
                update it when the user draws on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had to debug this by rendering a cube rather than an imported mesh, since we were running into
                loading errors simultaneously. This problem was later fixed <a href="#problems"> as described here</a>.
            </p>
            <!-- video of the cube painting on -->

        </li>
        <li>
            Importing and exporting mesh and texture files
            <p>
                To implement support for importing files, we began an instance of createElement('input').
                 This allowed us to define the type of file that we can import and what to do with the contents. 
                 Inside the function for the texture images, we mapped it onto the loaded mesh. For loading in a 
                 GTLF/GLB, the variables that define the mesh are adjusted to the new mesh that was imported. 

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Implement raycasting in order to draw onto the mesh
            <p>
                This was one of the more challenging parts of the project. Upon researching
                 techniques on how to paint over meshes, we stumbled across a few resources.
                  <a href="https://tomtung.github.io/chameleon.js/">This demo </a> takes inspiration
                   from the <a href="http://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/papers/i3dg2001.pdf">following paper</a>.
                    It dynamically creates and unwraps the UVs of a mesh so that painting
                   on the mesh is fast and efficient as opposed to drawing over a mesh that is already
                    UV unwrapped and static. However, the paper states that the limitations of this 
                    program can only be used to paint on meshes casually rather than for animated 
                    film or game assets, which require carefully-placed UVs from the start for texture
                     mapping and skinning. Thus, we decided to base our implementation by drawing on a 
                     static UV unwrapped mesh, because we wanted our program to mirror other professional 
                     3D paint programs and teach others how UV mapping works.

            </p>
            <p>
                The diagram below illustrates how we ended up implementing drawing directly onto
                 the mesh via raycasting. ThreeJS has its own raycaster class, and handles intersections
                  with faces on a mesh. Upon calling the intersect method, we can directly obtain the face
                   in which the mouse intersected, and its corresponding interpolated UV coordinates.
                    Once the UV coordinates are obtained, we can calculate their position on the drawing 
                    app by scaling with the corresponding width and height of the canvas. We scale (1-v) 
                    by the height instead of v because ThreeJS reads the top left UV coordinate as (0,0).

            </p>

            <figcaption >Our raycasting implementation on the banana mesh, a visualization</figcaption>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a toggleable UV shell layer
    <p>
        The vertices of a face are connected and each vertex corresponds to one UV coordinate. To render
        the UV shell layer, we iterate through the faces of the mesh, find the corresponding UV coordinates
         and connect them into a triangle. The difficulty comes in identifying faces. In code, the faces are 
         represented as a buffer of indices where each consecutive trio of indices form a face. We can use these 
         indices to get the corresponding UV coordinates from the buffer.
    
    </p>
    <p>
        To make the UV shell toggleable, we used two canvas elements: “drawingapp” is the drawable texture layer 
        and “uv-mesh” isolate the UV shells. By setting the position to “absolute” in CSS, we were able to stack 
        the two canvas elements on top of each other, thus treating them as canvas “layers”. Now, we are able to 
        draw and erase them separately.

    </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
<p>
    <b id="problems">Along the way, we encountered various issues with our project that we had to solve. We highlight the
    two most prominent problems we successfully tackled below:</b>
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling automatic multithreading in a Javascript context
            <p>
                We experienced a lot of problems initially with timing. Sometimes assets are called before 
                they are loaded. For example, the init function should be called first, where we initialize 
                the mesh and lights, then the main function loop, where we read off of the information from 
                the mesh. However, print debugging suggests that the assets haven’t yet finished loading until 
                after the main function loop has already started. We solved this via Javascript’s Promise API 
                holding the async and await system. Handling this was especially challenging when we had to combine
                the WebGL renderer and the canvas together.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Initially using Meshedit as our codebase
            <p>
                Originally, we intended to expand the functionality of the MeshEdit code for our project. 
                After working on this for three weeks, we opted to switch platforms because MeshEdit relies on OpenGL 2.1,
                 which is largely deprecated on Windows and Linux computers. Additionally, we encountered suspected errors 
                 within the texture coordinate and vertex buffers, causing our textures to render as individual triangles
                  on the mesh.

            </p>
            <img src="finalprojectimages/beantxt1.jpeg" height="400px" class="centerimg">
            <br>
            <figcaption>Texture map onto a bean mesh in our modified MeshEdit</figcaption>
            <p>
                After consulting with Prof. Ng and conducting our own research on the best graphics API for our purposes, we 
                stumbled across the Three.js API. This high-level framework provides a comprehensive set of tools for 
                implementing core graphics programs and algorithms in WebGL. Utilizing Three.js enables us to integrate our 
                project into the UCBUGG: 3D Modeling and Animation course webpage, where two of us serve as facilitators. 
                This integration aims to enhance students' understanding of UV mapping and texturing in a more intuitive
                 manner, while also providing a faster and more accessible way to texture meshes for their semester-long 
                 animated short film.

            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    <b>Throughout the time we spent working on this project, we took away the following lessons:

    </b>    </p>

<ul>
    <li>All of us have had minimal exposure to Javascript and fundamental front-end frameworks before this project. This project allowed us to use 
        concepts we learned in class, and implement them in a software engineering context.
    </li>
    <li>
        Because Javascript runs multi-threaded, we learned to leverage the Promise API to load necessary assets 
        first before reading off of them.
    </li>
    <li>
        We learned quite a bit of the backend behind the MeshEdit code, despite abandoning it 3/4th of the way through the project 
        timeline. However, a lot of concepts taken from the MeshEdit code transferred over to learning the ThreeJS API, such as the
         pipeline for creating a GL viewer, loading meshes and textures, and reading off of texture files.

    </li>
    <li>
        We also learned some OpenGL 2.1 commands such as using it to create a textured mesh via a vertex and texture coordinate buffer, 
        and memory allocation for storing mesh objects.
    </li>
</ul>

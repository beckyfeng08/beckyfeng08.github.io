<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>I implemented various sampling techniques for an SVG rasterizer, such as supersampling, bilinear interpolation, barycentric coordinates, and mipmapping.
  At the end, I used the rasterizer to render some of my own artwork.

  Throughout this project, I learned how to take mathematical techniques taught in class and apply them in my code, such as determining
  whether or not a point was within a given triangle, transforming objects via matrices, and using barycentric coordinates to interpolate
  colors.

<h3 id="part1">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p>In the <code>rasterize_triangle</code> function, I created a bounding box of a triangle
  given the coordinates, and went through every pixel in the bounding box. Then,
  I used a helper function, called <code>inside_t</code>, to determine whether or not the pixel was inside the 
  triangle. If it was, I would assign the given color to that particular pixel.
  If not, I would move on to the next pixel. </p>
<p>
  Below is a visual diagram of how I implemented the <code>inside_t</code> helper function. I formed three normal vectors
  given the vertices of the triangle, then used the dot product to determine whether the vector pointing to the sample point was in the 
  triangle or not. Three dot products were performed, one for each normal vector between two vertices of the triangle.
  The pixel is <i>inside </i> the triangle if the dot product yields a positive value, or a negative value for all three dot products.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/task1/task1_1.jpg" align="middle" width="800px">
  <figcaption>Visual digram of the <code>inside_t</code> helper function</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since I am implementing the <code>rasterize_triangle</code> function based upon iterating through every pixel within
the bounding box of a given triangle, my implementation is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/task1/task1_2.png" align="middle" width="800px">
  <figcaption> Screenshot of basic/test4.svg with the default viewing parameters</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><b>Extra credit:</b> I optimized my code so that it would only iterate through the left side of the triangle. I made a new variable
  called <code>prev_inside</code>, which equals 1 if the previous pixel was inside the triangle, and 0 if it wasn't. We
  move onto the next row of pixels if <code>prev_inside == 1 and inside == 0</code>, because we know that the pixels in the 
  rest of the row isn't in the triangle.
</p>
<p>I timed how long it took to render the lion SVG sixteen times for both the unoptimized and optimized version. The mean value for the optimized implementation 
  was 0.260 seconds, whereas the mean for the unoptimized was 0.289 seconds. Performing a 2-sample t-test with a 0.05 significance level, using the <code>scipy.stats</code> library, 
  we saw a significant difference between the two means.
  </p>
  <p>
  Below is a depiction of what the optimized version looks like for a single triangle compared to the unoptimized one:
</p>

<figcaption>Optimized vs unoptmized method of rendering a triangle. The green represents the indices we are iterating
  through. In the unoptimized implementation, we are iterating throught the bounding
  box of the triangle. In the optimized implementation, we move onto the next row of pixels
  after hitting the rightmost edge of the triangle.
</figcaption>
</figure>


<h3 id="part2">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p>I modified my sampling algorithm to include two more for loops - one loop
  for the column of the super samples, and another for the row. I used the 
  <code>sample_buffer</code> data structure available to us to assign the 
  color of the SVG at the particular super-sampled position. Since the sample_buffer
  buffer has a size of width*height*sample_rate, the color sampled at the (i, j)th pixel
  and the (l, k)th sample is given by <code>sample_buffer[sample_rate * (width*j+i) +
    k*samplecount + l]</code>.
</p>
<p>In the <code>resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> function, I read a batch of colors from 
  <code>sample_buffer</code> of size sample_rate. I used a helper function to average the
  colors in that batch, and put the RGB values inside the <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code>
  data structure provided to us.</p>

  <p>Supersampling is useful because it gives off an antialiasing effect. Otherwise,
    we would see jaggies along the edges of our rendered image, making the final product
    look awkward, and rough. Here is a side-by-side comparison of sampling once per pixel
    versus sampling 16 times per pixel:
  </p>

  <table style="width:100%;">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/task2/task2_1.png" align="middle" width="500px"/>

      </td>
    </tr>
    
  </table>
</div>
<p>In terms of modifications, I had to add two more for loops within my <code>rasterize_triangle</code>
function to account for supersampling within each pixel, as described above. In <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code>,
I needed to write the RGB values for the averaged color within that pixel.</p>
<p>I also modified <code>fill_pixel</code> to account for aliasing points as lines, similarly by sampling within
a particular pixel. This helped to reduce the effect of fading when upsampling.
Additionally, I modified <code>set_sample_rate</code> and <code>set_framebuffer_target</code>
to account for the resizing of the <code>sample_buffer</code>.
</p>
<p>To antialias my triangle, I averaged the color of the pixel based upon the supersamples within it.
  The process of averaging the colors was done in the helper function, <code>average_colors</code>. 
  Since each pixel was sampled <code>sample_rate</code> times, I 
  took out <code>sample_rate</code> number of colors out of the  <code>sample_buffer</code> 
  and outputted a color that was the average of the RGB values in the batch. The average was calculated by 
  taking the mean of the red, green, and blue channels for each sample in the batch.</p>

  <p>In the figures below, we see that as we increase the sample size, we experience
    less jaggies and more antialiasing. This is because taking more samples allows
    us to get more information on what proportion of a particular color is within the
    pixel so we can output the average color within it, and achieve a more, convincing
    and antialiased look.

  <p><b>Extra credit:</b> I implemented jittered sampling as an alternative solution to
  aliasing. Although it is faster than supersampling, the antialiasing is not nearly as good.
However, it does introduce more randomness than sampling, which can be good for antialiasing on more detailed
objects. </p>

  <p>I duplicated the original robot file, and made various changes in the translation, rotation, and scaling, and color
    of the robot's body. I even added a background by duplicating one of the shapes, and adjusting the translation and scaling
    as necessary.
    For example with the left arm, the following transformations were performed in this order:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      translate(250 250) (for the entire body)
    </li>
    <li>
      translate(-70 -10) (for the arm itself)
    </li>
    <li>
      rotate(-70)
    </li>
    <li>scale(.6 .2)</li>
    <li>rotate(-100) (for the upper arm)</li>
    <li>translate(-50 -30)</li>
    <li>scale(.6 .2)</li>

  </ol>
  <p>I switched the color by changing the hexcode.</p>
  <p><b>Extra credit:</b> I made a color picker that can be toggled in the rasterizer
  by pressing the 'W' key. The color picker zooms in where the mouse is hovered over,
and displays the RGB value of that pixel. I took the code for the zoom-in tool, resized it, and 
change the number of pixels to display to 1. Then, I got the RGB values by using
OpenGL's <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glReadPixels.xhtml">glReadPixels feature.</a></p>

<h3 id="part4">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>Barycentric coordinates are a way to linearly interpolate between points on a surface.
  An example can be shown below, where each vertex is associated with a color. In the middle of the triangle,
  we have a blend of all three colors - more red if the sample point is closer to the red coordinate, or an 
  equal blend of all three colors if the sample point is in the middle.

<h3 id="part5">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Pixel sampling is sampling a texture at every pixel. When a texture is applied
  to a shape, we may want to warp the texture. Thus, we must figure out 
  what pixels will be displayed with the warped texture in relation to the shape.
  Two methods of pixel sampling are <b>nearest pixel sampling</b> and <b> bilinear
   sampling</b>.
</p>
<p>Nearest pixel sampling is simply sampling the closest color value in the texture
  with the calculated UV coordinates. However, this method is prone to aliasing.
</p>
<p>Bilinear sampling is sampling a color found by interpolating between the four closest
  pixels in a texture map. As seen in the image below, the red dot represents a point being
sampled, the black dots represent pixels in the original texture with a defined color.
We linearly interpolate based upon these four black dots to obtain a blended hue for the red dot.
The resulting image is a smoother, and less jagged picture. </p>

</div>
<p>For the sample size of 1, we see that applying bilinear sampling gives a 
  slightly more smoother look-- although dark particles still appear here and there.
  For the sample size of 16, we see that these harsh changes in color have been relatively
  smoothed out, and even more so when we perform bilinear sampling.</p>
  <p>We will tend to see a larger difference between bilinear and nearest pixel sampling
    under lower samples. This is because the neighboring pixels for an image of sample size 1
    will have a greater variety of color due to aliasing, so it will be more noticeable
    when applying bilinear sampling.
    Since the supersampled version has already contributed to most of the smoothing,
    the neighboring pixels will be closer in color, and bilinear sampling won't improve the image quality as significantly.
  </p>
<h3 id="part6">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
  The more warped or scaled a texture is compared to the original, the higher
  mipmap level we want to use. Higher mipmap levels tend to be more blurred /
  interpolated so that we can minimize aliasing. In my implementation, I calculated
  the UV coordinates at pixels (x,y), (x+1, y), and (x, y+1) in our render. Then, 
  I determined du/dx, dv/dx, du/dy, and dv/dy given that dx = 1, dy = 1,
  and du and dv are the difference in their UV coordinate values at (x,y), (x+1, y) and 
  (x,y), (x, y+1), and scaled it according to the width of the mipmap. I used the following formulae below to get the correct
  mipmap level, D:

<p>I drew a Pikachu on a drawing app as a guide, and then using the rasterizer,
  I painstakingly colored it in using polygons by modifying the code inside the SVG file. Then, I rendered
  it with the rasterizer to make sure the polygons were placed correctly. The cheeks were rendered by
  duplicating one of the eye shapes and performing translation, rotation, and scale transforms implemented in 
  task 3. I also thought that the image would look better if I added some color jitter, so every few polygons, I modifed the hexcode by one digit. The
  gradient triangle in the background was rendered via the custom Colortri class implemented
  in this project in task 4.
